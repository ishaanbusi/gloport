            Photonics technology involves the generation, manipulation, and detection of light (photons) to achieve highly accurate measurements at the molecular level. In healthcare, this translates into powerful diagnostic tools that can detect subtle biological changes without the need for invasive procedures.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 text-left">
            At Gloport Photonix, we have developed proprietary systems that use photoacoustic spectroscopyâ€”a breakthrough technique that converts light energy into sound waves to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other disease markers in biological samples like breath. This allows us to detect diseases at their earliest stages, often before symptoms even appear.

          Our devices use precisely tuned multi-wavelength lasers to emit light into a biological sample (such as a patientâ€™s breath). When this light is absorbed by specific molecules (e.g., VOCs), it causes them to vibrate at a molecular level.

          As these molecules absorb the light, they generate tiny acoustic waves. This is the core of the photoacoustic effect, where light energy is converted into sound. These sound waves are directly proportional to the concentration of specific biomarkers present in the sample.
